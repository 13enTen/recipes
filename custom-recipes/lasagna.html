        <h2>Lasagna Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>To make a delicious homemade lasagna, start by cooking lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Next, prepare a rich meat sauce by browning ground beef with minced garlic and chopped onion, then simmering it with tomato sauce, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg and season it with salt and pepper. Begin assembling the lasagna by spreading a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of cooked noodles, then a layer of the ricotta mixture, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of mozzarella. Bake the lasagna in a preheated oven for about forty-five minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges are golden brown. Allow it to cool slightly before slicing and serving. Enjoy your hearty homemade lasagna!</p>
